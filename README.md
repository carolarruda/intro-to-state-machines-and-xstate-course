# Intro to State Machines and Xstate

- Course Introduction
- First machine
  - A humble light bulb
- Extending a machine
- Context
  - Extended state, often for infinite states
  - updated with `assign`
  - Can be an object, or an updater function: (context, event) => nextContext
- Events
  - Cause of a transition, state changes cannot occur without a sent event
- Actions
  - Single, discrete effects
  - Types of actions
    - Entry - executed when entering a state
    - Exit - executed when leaving a state
    - Transition - taken when a transition is taken
- Activities
  - continuous effects that are disposed when the state they were in are exited
  - Occurs over time
- Guards
  - Conditional logic for transitions
  - Uses a guard function, (context, event) => boolean
- Services
- Hierarchical States
  - Toggle with disabled state
  - There are two top states: enabled, disabled
  - Within the enabled state, there are two states: on, off
- Parallel states
- Transient State Nodes
  - Immediately transitions to another state
  - Useful for conditionally determining which next state to transition to
  - Could also be used to trigger effects and more
- Delayed Transitions/Events
  - `after` property
- History
  - Special state node that when reached tells the machine to go to the last state value of the region
    - `shallow` only the top level history value
    - `deep` children are updated too
